The **LU** decomposition factors a square matrix *A* into the product of two matrices:

> *A* = **LU**

where:

- **L** is a lower triangular matrix (all elements above the diagonal are zero);
- **U** is an upper triangular matrix (all the elements below the diagonal are zero).

Parallelization made using:
- OpenMP
- CUDA

Device used: Jetson Nano -->
